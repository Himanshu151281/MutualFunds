## How It Works

1. **Data Loading**: On component mount, all mutual funds are fetched from the MF API
2. **Debounced Search**: When user types 2+ characters, suggestions are filtered after 300ms delay
3. **Local Filtering**: Suggestions are filtered locally from the pre-loaded fund data
4. **Real-time Display**: Up to 8 relevant suggestions are shown in a dropdown
5. **Selection**: Users can click suggestions or press Enter to search

## Technical Implementation

### Components Used
- **UI Components**: Command, CommandList, CommandItem, CommandGroup, CommandEmpty
- **Layout**: Popover, PopoverContent, PopoverTrigger
- **Icons**: Search, TrendingUp, Building, X
- **Form Elements**: Input, Button

### API Integration
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.mfapi.in/mf`
- **Method**: GET request to fetch all mutual funds
- **Data Structure**: Array of funds with schemeCode, schemeName, and fundHouse

### Performance Optimizations
- **Debouncing**: 300ms delay before triggering search
- **Result Limiting**: Maximum 8 suggestions shown
- **Local Filtering**: Suggestions filtered from cached data
- **Lazy Loading**: Suggestions only loaded when needed

## Usage Examples

### Basic Implementation
```tsx
import SearchWithSuggestions from '@/components/SearchWithSuggestions';

<SearchWithSuggestions
  placeholder="Search mutual funds..."
  onSearch={(query) => console.log('Search:', query)}
  onSuggestionSelect={(suggestion) => console.log('Selected:', suggestion)}
/>
```

### With Search Button
```tsx
<SearchWithSuggestions
  placeholder="Search with button..."
  showSearchButton={true}
  onSearch={(query) => handleSearch(query)}
/>
```

### Controlled Component
```tsx
const [searchValue, setSearchValue] = useState('');

<SearchWithSuggestions
  value={searchValue}
  onChange={setSearchValue}
  placeholder="Controlled search..."
/>
```
